    And Marshall to my Mosby(Ha Ha next The Office hi dekhunga) 📺 
    Dont get flattered, bitch the chocolate count has crossed fifty 🍫 

    Unfortunate enought to lose that chair 😢 
    You know what? That wasnt fair😭 (Friends dont lie)
    How do you have such a pretty pretty smile😃 
    Reality Check: Your crushes are filling piles 📚

    Hey, Paris trip is still on right? 🗼 

    I told you I am your backup but you must start to worry
    Because I am getting ask outs oh so many(You know the truth 😿 )
    Now that we have a deal, you can never be at Peace ☮
